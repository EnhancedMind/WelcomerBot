To add user a custom sound, simply put a .mp3 file named 'USERID.mp3'  
You can get the user ID in discord after enabling developer mode by right clicking the user and selecting 'copy ID'  
you can add tags to the file name, but it needs to start with the user ID  
the tags are:  
- $join - play when the user joins the voice channel  
- $leave - play when the user leaves the voice channel  
- $ch=0.5 - set the probability of playing the sound when the user joins the voice channel (0 - 1)  
- $once - play the sound only once and never again  

You can also add the files into a folder named 'USERID' in the music/users folder, and you don't have to put the user ID in the file name thats inside the folder
